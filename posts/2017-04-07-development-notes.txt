<p>This project was built as an exercise in learning basic php programing, it might not be suitable for hard core production use, but it is a usable solution for a lightweight - single user blog.</p><h3>Built in functionality:</h3><ul><li>SEO friendly url, dynamic page titles and meta descriptions, including Open Graph meta tags.</li><li>Easy configurable site name, author, description/homepage text and copyright text.</li><li>Lightweight WYSIWYG to edit and create new posts, a modified version of <a href="http://alex-d.github.com/Trumbowyg">Trumbowyg</a> .</li><li>Pagination happens on client side built using <a href="http://luis-almeida.github.com/jPages">jPages</a> jquery plugin.</li><li>No database needed, posts are stored as html in .txt files.<br></li></ul><h3>Things to remember:</h3><ul><li>Not equiped for Latin or Cyrillic languages.</li><li>Strict file naming (slug) - always add date first in Y-M-D format, no capitalized letters, dash(-) instead of spaces, when creating new post in admin interface.</li><li>Basic image file upload, you can then insert images in your post using their URL(ex: media/mypic.jpg).</li><li>Admin page not secure, you can use htaccess to password protect this file.</li><li>Strictly Apache + htaccess and mod_rewrite engine on.</li><li>Enable public read+write permissions to "posts/" and "media/"&nbsp; folders. (chmod 755 or 777)</li></ul><h3>Bugs:</h3><ul><li>Fix file sort for same date files, it still outputs the files, but it orders them alphabetically. Probably not a big issue if you're not posting more than one article a day.</li></ul><h3>License</h3>
