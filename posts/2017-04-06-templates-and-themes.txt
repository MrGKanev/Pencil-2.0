<p>The html structure of all files used (index.php, view.php and admin.php) are very simple. The functions.php also has some html, but it does not necessarily have to be edited, just remember to use these classes in your css:</p><ul><li><b>.post-title</b> = references the post title on post pages (view.php).</li><li><b>.date</b> = references the date on post pages (view.php).</li><li><b>.warning, .success, .error</b> = used for messages on index and admin pages.</li></ul><p>The id <b>archives</b> <i>(#archives)</i> is used on the unordered list element that outputs the file names, displayed on the index and admin pages. It is used for the pagination script you can find in footer.php, and in functions.php - line 176.</p><p>The stylesheets are in <b>assets/css/</b>, these are divided in two files - <b>style.css</b> and <b>admin.css</b>. The admin.css complements the styles for the admin page only, and is only loaded on admin.php page. It basically contains styles for the buttons, form inputs and the WYSIWYG plugin styles. It depends on style.css for typography and layout styles.<br></p>
